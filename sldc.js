const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step the team will meet to understand what the customer wants for the MVP and make sure everyone is on the same page"
const design = "The UX designers will start creating wire-frames to provide the developers"
const implementation = "The developers will begin coding the software"
const testingAndIntegration = "The QA team will start testing the app and look for any bugs that a user could potentially come across"
const maintain = "After the software is deployed and able to be used by the customers the dev team will continue to take feedback from the product team and implement new features or content that the customer would like."
